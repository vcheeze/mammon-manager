## Project Structure 
The project is structured simply as client and server. The client
uses Vue.js, while the backend uses Node-Express to provide a REST
API. MongoDB is the database employed. In a nutshell, this project
uses the MEVN stack - **M**ongoDB, **E**xpress, **V**ue.js, and
**N**ode.js.

## How to run
For the server, `cd` into the server directory in your terminal
and run `npm run start`.
